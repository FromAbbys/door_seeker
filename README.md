Portscanner with some features

Hi, you can call me Abyss.

doorseeker is a simple portscanner with a few functions.

Remembering, its improper use may lead to consequences, I am NOT responsible for any damage caused.
Created for academic and study purposes.

python door_seeker.py -h

Its use is simple:

-t to inform the scan target
-p to set the scan limit, that is, the maximum port it will reach. By default only the first 1024 ports.
-s to inform what type of scan
-b to say whether or not the program will do banner grabbing

some parameters are mandatory, others are not.

The project is still at the beginning, but I intend to evolve it more and more, I'm learning python and with time I will add more features to it

Using example:
